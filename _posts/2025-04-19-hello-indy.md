## Meet the Author
Hey there! I’m Satej, and I have the privilege of being the first author of *Root Access*. I’m a passionate web and game developer who thrives on crafting innovative solutions to challenges. At the time of writing, I’m proud to hold a Silver ranking in the USA Computing Olympiad, and my team has reached the prestigious Platinum Division in the National Youth CyberPatriot competition. 

I work with a variety of technologies, including `C++20`, `React`, `C#`, and `Python3`. I can’t wait to share my journey and insights with you all!

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Main() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Thanks for reading!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Main;
```

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Thanks for reading!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Thanks for reading!");
    }
}
```

```python
print("Thanks for reading!")
```
